# Forecasting Stocks and Market With Machine Learning

The best estimation ways of buying-selling time for a particular stock exchange were researched and analyzed. Different approaches were applied to the problem. Artificial intelligence can predict future predictions better than done. Therefore, it was thought that the prediction of disaggregated data may show stronger and more accurate estimates than using all data. However, better mathematical modeling such as regression makes this easier. It was decided to use LSTM, which would be useful to predict the trend, which is a component of the data. Meanwhile, it is possible to train the data in the long term and to see possible results with low error rate. Then it was aimed to reach the best working system. Based on the studies, the estimate was combined with Machine Learning and the trend estimate LSTM to get the prediction of all time series.
